<h2 id="top"><u>Energy Conservation</u></h2>

<p>Energy conservation refers to reducing energy consumption through using less of an energy service. Energy conservation differs from efficient energy use, which refers to using less energy for a constant service. For example, driving less is an example of energy conservation. Driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency. Energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques.</p> 
<p>It is important in today's world because, climate change is happening and is caused by the release of increasing quantities of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, such as burning gas in our cars and oil to generate electricity. Because much of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions is a result of burning fossil fuels for energy, energy efficiency has a key role in tackling climate change. By using energy more wisely, we need less energy to fulfill our needs. </p>
